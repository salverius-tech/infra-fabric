# homelab-infra values template

This directory is a public-safe template for `values/`, the nested private Git repo that stores site values and state.

`values/` is ignored by the public runbooks repo. In normal use it has its own private remote, such as a Forgejo repository, and is committed/pushed separately from this repo.

## Files

- `.env` — local credentials and bootstrap environment variables, including Hermes Agent dashboard auth secrets.
- `terraform.tfvars` — site-specific Proxmox/LXC/OpenTofu variables, including optional per-container VLAN tags and the optional disabled-by-default Tailscale client LXC.
- `dns-records.local.json` — site-specific Technitium DNS zones and records.
- `ansible/inventory/local.yml` — site-specific Ansible inventory and role variables. The Technitium Caddy proxy uses `caddy_server_names` for DNS UI aliases such as `dns.example.internal` and `technitium.example.internal`.

## Initialize

From the runbooks repo root:

```bash
cp settings.example.json settings.local.json  # optional local setup defaults
just setup
```

Or clone an existing private values repo, such as the Forgejo-hosted values repo, during setup:

```bash
just setup git@git.example.internal:owner/homelab-infra-values.git
```

When run interactively, `just setup` starts setup wizards if private values still have scaffold placeholders. The Proxmox wizard asks for the Proxmox host, tests root SSH key access, offers an alternate key file or a command to authorize your default public SSH key if default keys fail, creates/updates a Proxmox API user/token, and stores the endpoint/token/SSH target in `.env` without printing the token secret. The domain wizard asks for your base domain plus a starting service IP, then derives static LXC addresses and names such as `dns.<domain>`, `technitium.<domain>`, `git.<domain>`, `infisical.<domain>`, and `hermes.<domain>` in the authoritative private values files. To rerun the Proxmox wizard later from the runbooks repo root:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-pve-token.sh --force
```

To rerun the domain wizard:

```bash
scripts/python.sh scripts/bootstrap-domain.py --force
```

Container VLAN tags default to `null`, which leaves the LXC interface untagged.
Set the matching `*_vlan_id` value to a VLAN ID from 1 through 4094 when the
Proxmox bridge should tag that container interface.

After editing the copied files, run the normal validation entry point:

```bash
just validate
```

Keep `.env` in dotenv-style `KEY=value` or `export KEY=value` format. The runbooks parse it as data and reject shell execution patterns.

For Hermes dashboard form login, store `HERMES_DASHBOARD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`, not a plaintext password. Generate it with:

```bash
python scripts/hermes-password-hash.py
```

For Forgejo Actions deployment, set `FORGEJO_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_SECRET` to a persistent 40-character hex secret and enable `forgejo_runner` in `settings.local.json` services before planning the runner LXC.
