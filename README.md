# Homelab Infrastructure Runbooks

Reusable OpenTofu and Ansible runbooks for Proxmox LXCs running Technitium DNS, Caddy, Forgejo, Infisical, Hermes, and optional runner/VPN services.

This public repo is intentionally generic. Real domains, LAN IPs, DNS records, Proxmox endpoints, credentials, and state belong in `values/`, an ignored nested Git repo. In a typical install, `values/` is pushed to a private Forgejo repository while this runbook repo stays public-safe.

## Layout

Tracked public source:

```text
infra/opentofu/    OpenTofu configuration and Technitium DNS API helper
infra/ansible/     Ansible playbooks and roles for in-LXC service config
scaffold/          Public-safe starter files copied into values/
scripts/           Local workflow helpers
tools/             Docker tooling image
```

Ignored site/local state:

```text
values/            Nested private Git repo for site values/state
.terraform/        OpenTofu/Terraform working data
tfplan             Local plan artifact
```

Keep non-public material in `values/` or outside this checkout; do not add another sensitive-data directory to this repo.

## Fresh setup

Local prerequisites are Git, Docker/Docker Compose, and `just`. Python, OpenTofu, Ansible, TFLint, ShellCheck, SSH client usage for setup/apply, and related tooling run inside the Docker tooling container. Your host SSH directory is mounted read-only so the container can use your existing Proxmox SSH key when a command opts in.

From a fresh checkout, optionally copy the local settings template:

```bash
cp settings.example.json settings.local.json
```

Edit `settings.local.json` if you want `just setup` to clone your private `values/` Git repo. For example, set `values_repo.remote` to your Forgejo SSH URL. The file is ignored by Git. Supported services are defined in `infra/services.json` and currently include `technitium`, `forgejo`, `tailscale_client`, `forgejo_runner`, `infisical`, `infisical_onramp`, `hermes`, `onramp_host`, and `searxng_onramp`; `technitium` includes its Caddy proxy, LXC browser-facing services use service-local Caddy, `onramp_host` prepares a Debian 13 Podman VM with shared Caddy, `infisical_onramp` and `searxng_onramp` deploy rootless services on that VM, and `forgejo_runner` creates/configures a separate Forgejo Actions runner LXC.

Then run:

```bash
just setup
```

This builds the local tooling container and creates `values/` from `scaffold/`, or clones the `values_repo.remote` configured in `settings.local.json`. If no remote is configured and setup is interactive, it can ask for a base domain, probe `git.<domain>` for an accessible `homelab-infra-values` repository, save the discovered remote in ignored `settings.local.json`, and clone it. It also starts setup wizards for Proxmox API access and domain-derived service names. The Proxmox wizard asks for your Proxmox host, verifies root SSH key access, offers an alternate key file or a command to authorize your default public SSH key if default keys fail, creates/updates a dedicated Proxmox API user/token, and writes the endpoint/token/SSH target to `values/.env` without printing the token secret. The domain wizard asks for your base domain plus service IPs, then derives names such as `dns.<domain>`, `technitium.<domain>`, `git.<domain>`, `infisical.<domain>`, `hermes.<domain>`, and `searxng.apps.<domain>` in the authoritative private values files.

You can also pass the values repo URL directly:

```bash
just setup git@git.example.internal:owner/homelab-infra-values.git
```

Then edit the remaining private files:

```text
values/.env
values/terraform.tfvars
values/dns-records.local.json
values/ansible/inventory/local.yml
```

If you skipped the Proxmox token wizard or need to rotate the token later, run:

```bash
scripts/bootstrap-pve-token.sh --force
```

If you need to rerun the domain wizard, run:

```bash
scripts/python.sh scripts/bootstrap-domain.py --force
```

## Daily workflow

Validate public source and private values wiring:

```bash
just validate
```

`just validate` runs source checks, linting, tests, and private `values/` wiring checks. Use it as the normal validation entry point.

Check for eligible pinned version updates without applying infrastructure changes:

```bash
just update
```

`just update` checks known upstream releases and only updates pins for releases at least 48 hours old. It currently manages tool pins such as OpenTofu/TFLint and service pins such as Forgejo and Forgejo runner where the repo has a deterministic update target. Review the resulting diff before continuing with validation and planning.

Technitium is planned to move into this managed update path. The intended model is to read Technitium release metadata from GitHub, pin the desired DNS Server version plus the SHA256 of the portable tarball in private values, optionally cache the tarball under ignored `values/artifacts/technitium/`, then let Ansible update the LXC only when the installed marker differs from the pin. Until that is implemented, do not treat rerunning the upstream `install.sh` as an acceptable routine update mechanism.

Review infrastructure/DNS changes:

```bash
just plan
```

Apply the reviewed plan and configure services with Ansible:

```bash
just apply
```

`just plan` writes `tfplan` plus `tfplan.meta.json`. `just apply` refuses to run if the saved plan or its inputs changed, then applies infrastructure, runs enabled Ansible service chains in dependency-safe parallel waves, and syncs Technitium DNS records after the DNS service is installed. Set `INFRA_APPLY_ANSIBLE_MODE=sequential` to use the older one-playbook-at-a-time behavior, or `INFRA_APPLY_ANSIBLE_MAX_WORKERS=<n>` to cap parallel service chains. It removes plan artifacts after the apply attempt. `TECHNITIUM_API_URL` should use the direct LXC API endpoint (`http://<technitium-lxc-ip>:5380/api`) so DNS sync does not depend on records it creates. If the Technitium token is missing or still a placeholder, apply bootstraps one through the local API and stores it in `values/.env` without printing the token.

After a successful apply, review and commit the private `values/` repo because OpenTofu state and local inventory may have changed:

```bash
git -C values status --short
git -C values add -- terraform.tfstate terraform.tfstate.backup ansible/inventory/local.yml dns-records.local.json
git -C values commit -m "chore: update local infrastructure state"
git -C values push
```

## Forgejo Actions deployment

The optional `forgejo_runner` service creates a separate Forgejo Actions runner LXC. Keep the runner repository-scoped to the private `values/` repository and use the `homelab-deploy` label for deployment workflows. The runner uses a host execution label so it can run the repo's Docker-backed `just validate`, `just plan`, and `just apply` workflow; do not share it with untrusted repositories. Enable `forgejo` together with `forgejo_runner`; runner registration depends on Forgejo being present and configured first.

Bootstrap order:

1. Add `forgejo_runner` to `settings.local.json` services.
2. Set `FORGEJO_RUNNER_REGISTRATION_SECRET` in `values/.env` to a persistent 40-character hex secret.
3. Configure `forgejo_runner_scope` in private inventory as the private values repo owner/name.
4. Run `just validate`, review `just plan`, then run `just apply` after approval.
5. Commit and push `values/.forgejo/workflows/deploy.yml` in the private values repo.

After bootstrap, pushes to the private values repo can run the deployment workflow automatically when a matching runner is online.

## Service storage

Durable service storage is configured in `values/terraform.tfvars` through `service_storage`. The storage `type` describes how a service receives storage: `bind`, `proxmox_volume`, `guest_nfs`, `guest_cifs`, or `none`. For `bind` storage only, `host_prepare` describes optional Proxmox-node preparation of the bind source, such as `directory`, `zfs_dataset`, `host_nfs_mount`, or `host_cifs_mount`.

The scaffold defaults Forgejo data to `proxmox_volume` to avoid assuming a host ZFS pool. Existing legacy Forgejo ZFS variables are migrated to `service_storage` automatically. See `scaffold/README.md` for complete examples.

## Private values repo

`values/` is a separate Git repository nested inside this checkout. It is ignored by the public runbook repo and should be pushed only to a private remote, such as your Forgejo instance. `just setup` either clones that repo from `settings.local.json` / the CLI argument, or initializes a new local `values/` repo from `scaffold/`.

The scaffold defines this shape:

```text
values/
  .env
  terraform.tfvars
  dns-records.local.json
  ansible/inventory/local.yml
```

Use normal Git commands against the nested repo when you need to inspect, commit, or push private values:

```bash
git -C values status --short --branch
git -C values remote -v
```

## Responsibilities

OpenTofu manages:

- Proxmox LXC resources, including optional per-container VLAN tags when
  `*_vlan_id` values are set in `values/terraform.tfvars`
- Optional Tailscale client LXC shape, disabled by default until `tailscale_client_enabled` is set in private values
- Optional Forgejo Actions runner LXC when `forgejo_runner` is enabled in local settings
- Optional Infisical secrets service, either as the legacy LXC with service-local Caddy or as `infisical_onramp` on the shared onramp host
- Optional Hermes management LXC with SSH tooling, a non-root `anvil` dashboard runtime user, and a service-local Caddy reverse proxy for the Hermes Agent web dashboard
- Optional Debian 13 Podman `onramp_host` VM substrate for app services, using `anvil` as the default cloud-init/deploy user and a shared Caddy instance with per-service snippets. The boot source is a clean Debian 13 genericcloud image imported by OpenTofu from the URL declared in private `values/terraform.tfvars`.
- LXC bind mount or Proxmox-managed volume attachments for services that use durable storage

Ansible manages:

- Optional Proxmox host storage preparation for bind mounts before OpenTofu apply
- LXC lifecycle readiness on the Proxmox host, followed by direct SSH/become service configuration on each service host
- Technitium installation
- Caddy installation/configuration directly on the Technitium LXC. The scaffold exposes the Technitium UI at both `dns.example.internal` and `technitium.example.internal`; set `caddy_server_names` in private inventory for your real domain aliases.
- Forgejo installation/configuration, including Actions settings
- Caddy and OpenSSH integration on the Forgejo LXC
- Forgejo Actions runner installation/registration on a separate LXC
- Infisical Docker Compose stack on the legacy LXC, or rootless Infisical Podman stack on `onramp_host` when `infisical_onramp` is enabled
- Hermes management tooling, SSH-oriented bootstrap directories, the Hermes Agent web dashboard running as `anvil`, and Caddy
- App-host SSH hardening, rootless Podman readiness, `anvil` deploy-user setup, shared Caddy setup, default-deny host firewall policy, and deployment directory preparation
- Temporary SearXNG onramp workload deployment with rootless Podman, a shared Caddy site snippet, Technitium DNS record input, and Hermes endpoint env wiring when `searxng_onramp` is enabled
- Optional Tailscale installation and private backup restore on the Tailscale client LXC
- Technitium DNS records/settings through `infra/ansible/playbooks/technitium-dns.yml`

Ansible inventory combines `values/ansible/inventory/local.yml` with `infra/ansible/inventory/tfvars.py`, which derives service hosts, VMIDs, and addresses from `values/terraform.tfvars` using `python-hcl2`. Normal service diagnostics and steady-state configuration use each service's direct inventory group, such as `technitium`, `forgejo`, `infisical`, or `hermes`; Proxmox access is reserved for lifecycle readiness, storage prep, bootstrap/recovery, and explicit host-boundary work.

## Safety

Do not apply without reviewing `just plan` output. If `just apply` says the saved plan is stale, rerun `just plan` and review it again. Do not commit secrets, state, plans, or real site values to the public repo.

`settings.local.json` is the local operator settings file. It can set `values_repo.remote` for setup and the `services` list used by OpenTofu planning plus Ansible validation/apply. Removing a service from the list tells OpenTofu to stop maintaining its resources, which can plan destroys; review `just plan` before applying.

Container VLAN tags are optional. Omit a `*_vlan_id` variable or set it to
`null` for an untagged LXC interface; set it to a VLAN ID from 1 through 4094
for a tagged interface. The selected Proxmox bridge must already be configured
for that VLAN.

Browser-facing services with DNS records should use static LXC IP addresses,
not DHCP-only addresses. The setup wizard derives contiguous static service IPs
from the first managed service IP you provide and keeps `*_lan_ip`, LXC network
configuration, and Technitium DNS records aligned.

Hermes dashboard uses a form-login provider named `basic`. Store
`HERMES_DASHBOARD_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH` in private values instead of a
plaintext password; generate it with `python scripts/hermes-password-hash.py`.
The service-local Caddy config rewrites the upstream provider redirect to the
form login route and proxies only to the loopback-bound dashboard. Hermes `web-searxng` plugin/runtime should read the SearXNG endpoint from the
Hermes-native `SEARXNG_URL` environment key. Private values keep the same
endpoint as `HERMES_WEB_SEARXNG_URL`, and Ansible renders both names into the
Hermes dashboard environment for compatibility. When `searxng_onramp` is
enabled, this repo temporarily manages that endpoint on `onramp_host` as
`https://searxng.apps.<domain>` or the private equivalent.

`values/.env` is parsed as dotenv-style data by `scripts/parse-env.py`; it is not sourced as shell. Keep required variables from `scaffold/.env.example` in sync with your private `values/.env`.

The tooling container runs as the unprivileged `anvil` user and mounts `${HOST_SSH_DIR:-${HOME}/.ssh}` read-only. It copies public SSH support files into `/home/anvil/.ssh` by default; set `INFRA_COPY_SSH_KEYS=true` only when private keys must be copied into the container for a run. Direct service runs should use strict host-key checking with a gitignored managed known-hosts file such as `values/ansible/known_hosts`; changed trusted keys should be treated as a safety event, not refreshed silently.
