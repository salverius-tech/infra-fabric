# Debian baseline

This runbook uses Debian 13 as the default guest baseline:

- **LXCs** (Technitium, Forgejo runner, Infisical, Hermes, Tailscale client, and LXC-mode services) are created from the Proxmox `debian-13` standard container template represented by the `debian_template_*` OpenTofu variables.
- **Service VMs** use Debian 13 genericcloud images through the shared VM image variables.
- **`onramp_host`** remains provisioned as a Debian 13 genericcloud VM.

Changing `debian_template_*` affects newly created LXCs. Existing containers do not change operating-system baselines in place because the LXC module ignores `operating_system[0].template_file_id` drift to avoid accidental guest replacement. To move an existing LXC to the current Debian 13 template, rebuild that guest through the reviewed `just plan` / approved `just apply` workflow.

When rebuilding stateful services, review the plan carefully and confirm any replacements explicitly. Preserve service data with external storage or backups when desired; this repository does not automatically migrate arbitrary in-guest state between OS baseline rebuilds.
